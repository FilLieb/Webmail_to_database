Appending Excel sheet with info from standardized Emails

This code was designed to login into webmail at the University of Cologne Germany https://webmail.uni-koeln.de/ (prompt to type in username and password) and to retreive information from specific standardized emails (in this case nobody@uni-koeln.de).

Info is used to append excel sheet, in this case for a logbook of an instrument.
